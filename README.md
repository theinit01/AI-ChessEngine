# Chess Engine
## Overview 
This is a Python-based chess engine that allows users to play chess against the computer. The engine is capable of generating moves for the AI player using a combination of search algorithms, evaluation functions, and game-specific heuristics.




## Features  
- Play chess against the computer AI. 
-  Implement various chess strategies, including opening book, midgame tactics, and endgame knowledge. 
-  Visualize the chess board and current game state using ASCII representation. 
-  Implement different search algorithms for move generation, such as minimax with alpha-beta pruning.
